## Description

_This webpage will require you to enter a number.  A list of number will be output, but you'll notice something funny: numbers divisible by 3 will be replaced with "ping"; numbers divisible by 5 will be replaced with "pong"; and numbers divisible by 3 an 5 will be replaced with "pingpong". Enjoy!_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone github repository to your desktop_
* _open index.html in browser of choice_
* _enter a number and see what happens!_

## Known Bugs

_As far as I can tell, the syntax for preventDefault is correct.  But I can't get it to behave correctly.  Instead of the previous array being replaced by a new array, the new array is appended after the previous array._
